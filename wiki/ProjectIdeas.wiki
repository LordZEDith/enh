#summary Ideas that I haven't done much/any work on.

== Simpler "deskbar" ==

Ever since Google started with "onebox" (http://www.google.com/enterprise/gsa/onebox.html) and Apple's Spotlight added calculator functionality, I've wanted something similar for the Linux desktop. There are several contenders, but they're typical Linux apps, favoring power over simplicity. Deskbar (http://www.gnome.org/projects/deskbar-applet/) seems like the least worst, but it's got a more complicated UI than I'd like, and requires extensions be written in Python.
  * As simple as (or simpler than!) onebox or Spotlight.
    * 123lbs, 5'4", 78F => 56kg, 1.62m, 26C (i.e. unit conversion, taking what people actually write, assuming the obvious target unit, and retaining the likely precision)
    * 2+3*4, sin(90) => 14, 1.0 (i.e. basic calculator)
    * "15mins check oven", "21:30 take pill" => set timers (for stuff not worth adding to a calendar).
    * track parcels via tracking numbers.
    * contacts. (most useful somewhere with LDAP, since i don't keep my own address book.)
  * But maybe take into account that I'm a power user, and let me specify a verb?
    * "a gears of war", "i lord of war", "w gears of war", "gears of war" => amazon, imdb, wikipedia, and google searches.
    * "m 2 read", "j String" => man -s 2 read, latest javadoc for String
    * or Google-style "man:read(2)", "java:String", and so on. doesn't work well for things that are usually more than one word ("imdb:lord of war" would need extra quoting, for example, or maybe something like "imdb:" is a token in its own right that puts you in imdb mode for the rest of the tokens?).
    * leo.org translation? (what would be a convenient interface?)
    * dictionary/thesaurus? (plan 9 ones are good)
    * bug databases that i use? (my home projects, my work database, Sun's Java database...)
  * Some way to let people add their own stuff, without dictating an implementation language.
  * I'd rather write the core in Java than anything else; use gconf-editor and /apps/metacity/keybinding_commands to get a global keyboard shortcut? What about Mac OS and Windows?

Microsoft's doing something sort-of similar (http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2009/02/live-search-instant-answers-right-in-the-ie8-search-box.ars). And Google has a Mac-only Quick Search Bar (http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/).

== A to-do app that doesn't suck? ==

I've tried several to-do apps, plain text, wiki pages, bug databases, and paper, and I'm still not happy. Is "happy" possible? (The guy wrote wrote http://shawnblanc.net/2009/01/a-review-of-two-things/ seems happy.)

== code.google.com wiki markup translators ==

I've already got a Talc script to convert man pages to code.google.com wiki markup, and [http://code.google.com/p/blog-baboon/ blog-baboon] uses a subset of the same markup, but how about:
  * Converting to/from LaTeX (for printing)?
  * Converting to/from HTML (so this same markup can be used independently of code.google.com)? (See [http://code.google.com/p/blog-baboon/ blog-baboon] for a subset.)

== Log viewer ==

car wonders about hacking Terminator to be a log viewer. Apple has Console.app. GNOME has System Log Viewer. I tend to use "tail -F". Random ideas:
  * Could cope with .gz logs (unlike GNOME).
  * Could transparently stitch rotated logs together.
  * Could divide into days (like GNOME, which even shows a calendar).
  * Could filter (like Console.app).
  * Usual "jessies" find.
  * Could show as table (like Console.app in 10.5), or wrap (like XTerm), or scroll horizontally (like Terminator or GNOME).
  * Vim does simple coloring of some log formats.
  * Could gray out in each line every character (or run of a certain length?) that's the same as the previous line.
  * Could toFront/flash on new output.
  * Could offer setAlwaysOnTop.
  * "tail -F"-like automatic following of rotated logs.

== How (Software) Stuff Works ==

A tour (with minimalist implementations) of the basic bits of software:
  * ARM emulator (to give an overview of how a nice processor works).
  * ARM assembler/disassembler.
  * BASIC interpreter (or compiler, or both?). (See also BasicIdeas.)
  * higher-level VM?
  * a Unix shell?
  * anything else interesting enough? (should be non-trivial yet practical.)
  * what implementation language? C++ or Java?

== Hack on Maxine ==

Sun's [https://maxine.dev.java.net/ maxine] JVM looks mildly interesting.
  * Linux support?
  * ARM support?
  * see what else comes to mind if/when i can actually run it ;-)

== v8jam ==

Any benefit to using the [http://code.google.com/p/v8 v8] GC in jam? How about the JIT? Jam starts up very fast, and is fast as interpreters go, but it's seriously slow compared to !HotSpot/GCJ generated code.

== Android on Linux ==

Might be interesting to be able to run Android stuff native on Linux. Either by porting the GUI stuff and sticking with DalvikVM, or porting the Android stuff to Sun's JVM/Java2D and so forth.
