= How (Software) Stuff Works =

A tour (with minimalist implementations) of the basic bits of software:
  * ARM emulator (to give an overview of how a nice processor works).
  * ARM assembler/disassembler.
  * BASIC interpreter (or compiler, or both?).
  * higher-level VM?
  * a Unix shell?
  * anything else interesting enough? (should be non-trivial yet practical.)
  * what implementation language? C++ or Java?

= p9term =

A reimplementation of Plan 9's 8.5 windows, in Java using PTextArea, looking like it belongs in 2008 rather than 1988.
  * commit prototype i have; it's useless but good-looking (should go far!).
  * how best to deal with tab completion?
  * color?
  * use control-c and so on for editing; esc for "interrupt".
  * getting Bash to behave?
  * job control?
