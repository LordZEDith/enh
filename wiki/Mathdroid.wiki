====How do I get Mathdroid?==
If you just want to use Mathdroid, you can find it in the Market on your phone. Search for "Mathdroid".

It's a free download.

====How do I use Mathdroid once I've got it?==
Hopefully that's obvious when you run it. If not, there's built-in help. If you need more help, please tell me what you need to know more about.

====How do I report a bug/provide general feedback?==
Click on the "Issues" tab above and then click on "New issue". Or follow this direct link: [http://code.google.com/p/enh/issues/entry report a bug].

If you want to give me feedback that you don't think counts as an "issue", feel free to use the "Mail author" facility in the Market on your phone instead.

====Where's the source code?==
If you came here for the source code (as promised in the on-line help), click on the "Source" tab above.
