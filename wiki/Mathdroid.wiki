Mathdroid is a calculator for Android.

If you just want to use Mathdroid, you can find it in the Market on your phone. Search for "Mathdroid". It's a free download.

There's built-in help, so if you came here for more help, please file a bug telling me what you need to know more about.

If you came here to file a bug or suggest an improvement, click on the "Issues" tab above.

If you're shy, or just wanted to give me feedback that you don't think counts as an "issue", feel free to use the "Mail author" facility in the Market on your phone instead.

If you came here for the source code (as promised in the on-line help), click on the "Source" tab above.
