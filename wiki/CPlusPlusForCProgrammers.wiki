#summary A gentle introduction.

=C++ for C Programmers [DRAFT]=
FIXME: motivate by explaining how C++ can be seen (and used) as a "better C than C".
FIXME: explain (easy), (medium), and (hard).

==Rename .c to .cpp (easy)==
To take advantage of C++ features, you'll need to use the C++ compiler. The easiest way to do this is to use the {{{.cpp}}} extension instead of {{{.c}}}. Some people use {{{.cc}}} or {{{.cxx}}} but {{{.cpp}}} is the most widely-used.

Note that you can't tell from a {{{.h}}} file's extension whether it's a C or C++ header file. Some people use {{{.hpp}}} to make this explicit. If you're able, the easiest is to just decree that all {{{.h}}} files are C++. (See later for the details of mixing C and C++.)

==// comments (easy)==
You're probably already using C++'s {{{//}}} comments, which comment to end of line. They've been in C since C99, and were available as a non-standard extension in many compilers long before then. Use whatever you like:
{{{
// Single-line C++ comment.

/* Multi-line block
 * comment.
 */

// Multi-line C++
// comment.

/* Single-line block comment. */
}}}
(Both styles of multi-line comment are popular, but it's rare to see a C-style single-line block comment, just because it requires more keyboarding.)

==Minimal-scope locals (easy)==

==Mixing C and C++ (easy)==
