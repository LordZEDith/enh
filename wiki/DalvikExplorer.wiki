====How do I get Dalvik Explorer?==
If you just want to use Dalvik Explorer, you can find it in the Market on your phone. Search for "Dalvik Explorer".

It's a free download.

====How do I report a bug/provide general feedback?==

If you want to give me feedback that you don't think counts as an "issue", feel free to use the "Mail author" facility in the Market on your phone instead.
