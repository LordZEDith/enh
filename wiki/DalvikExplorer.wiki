#summary A debugging tool for Android.

====How do I get Dalvik Explorer?==
If you just want to use Dalvik Explorer, you can find it in the Market on your phone. Search for "Dalvik Explorer".

It's a free download.

====How do I report a bug/provide general feedback?==
Click on the "Issues" tab above and then click on "New issue". Or follow this direct link: [http://code.google.com/p/enh/issues/entry report a bug].

If you want to give me feedback that you don't think counts as an "issue", feel free to use the "Mail author" facility in the Market on your phone instead.

====Where's the source code?==
If you came here for the source code, click on the "Source" tab above and follow the instructions.

====Future Enhancements===

All text views should be copyable/mailable.

All list views should be substring searchable (as opposed to prefix-searchable, as they currently are).

The file system viewer should show information equivalent to "ls -l". Also MIME type.

The file system viewer should be able to (optionally) send round an intent for viewing/editing a file.

Add a character viewer? So you'd type 202a or whatever and get to see U+202a, plus maybe the result of all the methods in Character applied to that code point?
